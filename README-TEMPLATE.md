## User Experience

### User Stories

Use the "As a {user / site owner}, I want to {what do they want to achieve}, so that {why do they want to achieve that?} format.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

Include an image of the colour scheme to demostrate the colours you chose for your site.
There is a reason why you chose those colours - so you may as well tell them in your readme. I chose royal blue as the primary colour to signify trust and reliability which is important for a site promoting an accountants services.

[Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/)
Is a good site for checking colour contrast - it also nicely lays out your colours in a grid, so you can kill two birds with one stone.
Take a screenshot and put it in here - remember to mention that you checked the colour contrast to ensure your site was accessible.

### Typography

Oh so many fonts to choose from - You can spend hours deciding which font to use - or like me, you could use the same font for everything. If you chose a font for a specific reason, include the details here. If you didn't, you could mention how you decided on the different sizes for your headings versus paragraph text - or you could just remove this section.

### Imagery

The images you use in your site must remain consistent in style and feel. Here is a good place to let the reader know where you got them from, and how they impacted your overall design. Did you pick the colours based on the images that were available?

### Wireframes

If you made wireframes - include them here to demonstrate how you planned the site out.
Balsamic is a great little application - you get a trial key from CI as part of the course currently.. so you should use it.
It is drag and drop and very easy to use. It could prompt creative juices you didn't know you had.

### Figma/Full color mockup if produced

If you made a colour version of your site in an application like Figma, talk about it in the readme, why did you do that, what benefit did you get? I found it helped me visualise the colours better - therefore it really helped me with the design part because I couldn't picture the site properly in my head. Creating a full colour mockup is not a requirement for the course, or for getting top marks on any project - but if you put the work in, you may as well show it off.

## Features

### Feature title - e.g. Navigation

Screenshot of implemented feature
Description of the value this feature has for the users

Repeat for each feature

## Further Development

Describe some additional features you could potentially add to the project that would increase user value - could be things linked to technologies not yet covered by the course but would be a benefit to the user for example, the ability to save an article, or add an article to the site, leave a review.

## Testing

### Validation of Code

Insert screenshots of HTML, CSS and any other code files being tested in the relevant code validator - CSS validator might not validate newer CSS syntax - be careful to read and fully understand why it is giving you an error.

### Lighthouse

You can perform a test of your website for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO through the google chrome lighthouse test - it is in your Dev tools. Bear in mind that your internet connection speed plays a part in the performance figures obtained. Where it scores low, it will give you suggestions on how to improve the site - read the suggestions and think about how to implement them - it could be a good idea.
Do this for both Desktop and Mobile.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing

You can test your site for accessibility through the wave.webaim site - it needs to be deployed in order for it to test it. Fix any errors that it gives

### Manual Testing

You need to perform, and document everything you did to manually test your site.
At a minimum - you need to check every link on every page works as intended.
So that is check every link in the nav bar (do this on every single page because its a link in a different file) and any other links that appear on your site.
Test the responsiveness of the site - you can do this in the dev tools in responsive mode.
You should also load the site once deployed on as many devices you have access to. What is different from one device to the next? why is it different?

Test the user stories that you created earlier in the readme - did you satisfy the goal, how?

To write up the tests you can use a table,
Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail)

You should have tests for every section of every page.. individually.

## Technologies Used

Detail what technologies you used. So what code languages, what frameworks, libraries, what software did you use to develop the site - Balsamic for your wireframes, Figma for a mockup?

## Deployment

Detail how to clone the repository, how to fork the repository - how to run the site locally and how to deploy it.

## Credits

You need to credit where you got anything for your site from.. where are the images from, are they all from the same site? where did you get the content from, if you wrote it yourself, did you fact check anywhere? did you get code from anywhere? if so, it needs to be clearly marked in both the code and the readme.
